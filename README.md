# Offline-Data-Transfer-Manager
A Program that will Manage the data read/write of HDD's by queuing.

Such a tool may exist but unsure what to look for.

The Program I have in mind would be similar to an Internet Download Manager where you can pause certain files while assigning priorities etc but for files being proccessed on your system.

Take the following scenario for example:

Transfering multiple files from different directories to C: from External drive. Files all transfering at the same time share the transfer speed capabilities of the HDDs (C: and External), The USB Port/s and even the cable.
At the same time I am archiving files to an ISO on the external drive and installing software from C: to C:

I want a program that will assign ques for all of these tasks. 

EG.
Transfer order of files one after the other THEN complete archiving
Assigning read/write speeds to different tasks instead of windows auto management.

You all know, i think, that if you select one file to transfer then another it will do them at the same time but if you select them both at the same time then move them it will que them.

but what if the files are in different folders and you want to select them all then transfer so it is one job and it is queued?

I am no Coder, I dont have licenced software to write these programs, I dont have access to the tools and support required for a lot of such ideas. 

So I am putting it out there like everything else as public domain, free for all.
